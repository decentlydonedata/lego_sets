lego.py is a Python terminal based program which, through k-means clustering, a method of unsupervised machine learning, can recommend LEGO Sets. 

Features include:
- Recommendations either randomly, through user preferences (theme, price and number of minifigures) or via a user specified LEGO set.
- Search functions, by set-ID, name or theme of the LEGO set in order to find specific sets, their characteristics, a link via Brickset, as well as the ability to open an image of the set.
- Favourites list which can be edited and downloaded as a csv file.
- Statistics menu which allows the user to specify a subset of LEGO sets and then recieve summary statistics on the attributes

lego_sets_tidying.qmd was the R programed used for data wrangling producing lego_data_cleaned.csv which was the data set used in lego.py.

This project was undertaken across multiple weeks and was the final custom project for an introductory programming unit for which I recieved a HD for, without prior Python experience. 

lego_classification.qmd is a R program which uses multiple linear regression models to predict price of LEGO sets and classifies whether they are overpriced or underpriced and error rates.

lego_ols_analysis.qmd is a R program that reports graphs and ols regressions intended for hypothesis testing. 
- Use of log and polynomial transformations
- Use of interaction terms
- Testing for heteroskedasticity

lego_data_kaggle.csv and lego_sets_kaggle.csv were the data set used

This project represents the independent coding done to create example questions for end of semester revision sessions of first and second year econometrics, hosted by Economic Student Society of Australia.
