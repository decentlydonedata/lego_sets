This is a Python terminal based program which, through k-means clustering, a method of unsupervised machine learning, can recommend LEGO Sets. 

Features include:
- Recommendations either randomly, through user preferences (theme, price and number of minifigures) or via a user specified LEGO set.
- Search functions, by set-ID, name or theme of the LEGO set in order to find specific sets, their characteristics, a link via Brickset, as well as the ability to open an image of the set.
- Favourites list which can be edited and downloaded as a csv file.
- Statistics menu which allows the user to specify a subset of LEGO sets and then recieve summary statistics on the attributes

This project was undertaken across multiple weeks and was the final custom project for an introductory programming unit for which I recieved a 95/100 for.
